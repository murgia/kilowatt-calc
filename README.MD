Welcome to the Kilowatt Calculator!

This is a simple calculator used to calculate the approximate amount of energy you use for your home per year and how much that is costing you.

The steps for the calculator must be done in this order to save your electrical calculation and be able to compare it with others.

Type in the name of your home
Type in the abbreviation of your state and submit to retrieve average cost of electricity
Click the create elctrical calculation button
Fill out the calculator quantities
Create estimates
Check out your calculation
This app was originally designed to be just a front end web application but it evolved into a full web application that has the ability to be scaled up. User authorization could be implemented to give users access to electrical calculations that they have created. Full CRUD functionality for that would also be added.

Technologies used for this project:

PostgreSQL Data Base
Ruby on Rails back end
AngularJS front end framework
HTML
CSS
Thanks for stopping by!
